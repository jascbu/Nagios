My intention is for this repo to gradually contain a number of Nagios checks that I want to contribute back to the Nagios community.

I have written a number of Nagios checks and corresponding PNP4Nagios scripts.  They were written for work projects and contain some attributes specific to that environment and my plan is to generalise them to the point where I can push them up here and then make them available on the Nagios exchange.

Jascbu.
